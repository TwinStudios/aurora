= Aurora
== Simple Authentication and and User Management System

Aurora is a simple approach to authenticating users for applications with
varied permissions requirements and abstracting away the distinct
authentication process from the application in order to keep the application
flexible.

This allows for multiple applications all to interface with the same process
and not be concerned about the changing authentication process: switching
processes can be transparent to all of your apps.

== Halcyon

Aurora is written on top of Halcyon, a JSON Web Server App Framework built on
Rack. This allows for Aurora to be thin, lightweight, and fast.

== Development Status

Aurora is currently under restructure as Halcyon moves to a new architecture.
Documentation will be updated accordingly. These changes will make it easier to
specialize the authentication process and other features of Aurora to better
match the needs of your environment.

== Notes And Considerations

For the Authenticator class, have it test to see if self.authenticate is
defined, otherwise, use #authenticate so Authenticators don't have to be
instanciated unless they need to define initialize for connecting to
resources, etc.

This might also be addressed if Authenticators have to inherit from a Base
Authenticator which can provide a hook for self.startup, for instance.

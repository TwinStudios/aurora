= Aurora
== Simple Authentication Server

Aurora is a simple approach to authenticating users for applications with
varied permissions requirements and abstracting away the distinct
authentication process from the application in order to keep the application
flexible.

== Halcyon

Aurora is written on top of Halcyon, a JSON Web Server App Framework built on
Rack. This allows for Aurora to be thin, lightweight, and fast.

== Quick start

Aurora is still very early in development so a quick start will probably
consist mainly of checking out the code from the repository.

== Installing with RubyGems

A Gem of Aurora is available.  You can install it with:

  $ sudo gem install aurora

== Dependencies

Aurora is directly dependent on Halcyon, which also includes a number of great
gems:

* merb
* json
* rack

Aurora also requires a number of its own gems:

* ...

== Usage

The +aurora+ command will assist you for running the server. Just run:

  $ aurora -d -p 3800 example/simple
